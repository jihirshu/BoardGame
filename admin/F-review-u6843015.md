Review Comments:

Task 5 areConnectedNeighbours()

1. The documentation is well down 
2. The structure is good, short and the working is handled in the Tile class.

Task 6 isValidPlacementSequence() method

1. His code is well-documented, showing hwo the function is processed. 
2. The code is break down into the small function, which enhances readability of the code.
2. Didn't use the proper capitalization some times, like the Tile[] tile_array;


Task 10 generateMove()

1. This method is well-documented as well 
2. The code is not optimized as it takes lots of time to process
