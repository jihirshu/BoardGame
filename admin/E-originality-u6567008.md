I declare that the work I have submitted for Stage D of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The code in class Viewer that make two players use the same tiles and play on different board is my own idea.
* The idea of how to test TileToString is from a discussion between me and my group members.
