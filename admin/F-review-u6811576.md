Review Comments:

1. The author has followed Java varibale naming conventions (use of camelCase)
2. The readability of the code is good. Indentation is provided wherever needed.
3. Authorship Detail and a short description provided for each and every function.
4. Author has made good use of the concept of inner class to display tiles on the window.
5. Rotation of tile is not bi-directional. Scroll-up and scroll-down both rotate the tiles in the same direction.
6. Function makeBoard()(line 384-526) could be structured in a better manner by breaking up 
    parts of it into smaller functions.
