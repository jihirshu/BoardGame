Review Comments:

1. The program decomposition is appropriate.
2. Too many duplicate words on Gameover and Makeplacement method, can be improved.
3. Codes are well documented and it is clear to understand.
4. The variables are properly named.
5. There could be a restart game button on the game result window.
